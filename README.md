This project improves on an earlier project, by directly integrating security testing into a CI/CD pipeline via Jenkins.
The flexible Jenkins plugins ecosystem is exploited to enable docker image testing and application testing for microservices.
Test results are stored in a database for further risk analysis. 

Some inspirations are drawn from - https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Anchore+Container+Image+Scanner+Plugin
