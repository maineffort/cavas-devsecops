This project improves on an earlier project (https://github.com/maineffort/cavas-security-gateway), by directly integrating security testing into a CI/CD pipeline via Jenkins.
The flexible Jenkins plugins ecosystem is exploited to enable docker image testing and application testing for microservices.
Test results are stored in a database for further risk analysis. 

Some inspirations are drawn from - https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/Anchore+Container+Image+Scanner+Plugin

Some of the core ideas behind this project are published in our paper - CAVAS: Neutralizing Application and Container Security Vulnerabilities in the Cloud Native Era, presented at Securecomm 2018, Singapore.
