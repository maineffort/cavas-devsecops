<div>

  Select here which method you would like the plugin to use as input to an anchore policy evaluation.  The options are:
  <br>
  Automatic Bundle Sync: if you have access to the custom policy editor feature on https://anchore.io, and have set up a custom policy bundle, this option can be used to instruct anchore to log in and download your custom bundle before each evaluation is performed.
  <br>
  Bundle File Override: if you have a local copy of your custom bundle JSON document (policies, whitelists, and mappings), you can specify the local bundle.json file here.
  <br>
  Policy/Whitelist Override (default): you can specify local policy and optional whitelist files which will be used by anchore to perform an evaluation.  See the help for each entry to learn about behavior when a specified file is omitted/doesn't exist.
